4.12 (Date Class) Create a class called Date that includes three pieces of information as auto-implemented properties—a month (type int), a day (type int) and a year (type int). Your class should have a constructor that initializes the three automatic properties and assumes that the values provided are correct. Provide a method DisplayDate that displays the month, day and year separated by forward slashes (/). Write a test app named DateTest that demonstrates class Date’s capabilities.
